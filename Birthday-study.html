      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is to test the influence of two individual difference factors, motivation for alcohol and cognitive control, on alcohol use and problems in young adults making the transition to legal drinking (i.e., the 21st birthday). The study will examine how these processes contribute to the increase in alcohol problems, especially alcohol-impaired driving, that is known to occur in the year after the 21st birthday. Knowledge gained from this research will inform efforts to reduce alcohol-related problems in young adult drinkers. </p>

      
      
      <h4> What will I be asked to do? </h4>
<p>This study involves 3 to 4 in-person lab sessions: (121 Psychology Building; University of Missouri; Columbia MO 65211)</p>
<li>The first lab visit ("Baseline 1"" or "BL1") will occur up to 6 weeks <b>before</b> your 21st birthday.</li>
<li>Some participants, but not all, will be asked to return to the lab for another baseline visit (BL2) right after turning 21.</li>
<li>Alcohol Session #1 will occur up to 6 weeks after your 21st birthday.</li>
<li>Alcohol Session #2 will occur up to 8 weeks after your 21st birthday, and within 1 or 2 week of the Alcohol Session #1.</li>
<p>The study also involves two online follow-up surveys:
Follow-up #1 will occur 4 months after your 21st birthday.
Follow-up #2 will occur 10 months after your 21st birthday.</p>



      
      What will happen during the baseline lab session?
    
    During the baseline session, you will be asked to:
•	Complete a breathalyzer test (note: if your BrAC is not 0, we will ask you to reschedule) and have your height, weight, and head circumference measured by the research team;
•	Complete several computer-based tasks involving pictures of alcohol and other items while your brain activity is measured using electrodes placed on your scalp;
o	A beverage-smelling task which will be video recorded for behavioral observation;
o	Picture-viewing tasks including pictures of beverages, everyday objects and shapes;
o	Tasks to test your cognitive abilities (e.g., visual detection, memory, reaction time);
o	Tasks involving making decisions about how much you would pay for drinks in different hypothetical scenarios and your willingness to drive after consuming different numbers of drinks in these scenarios;
•	Complete several questionnaires on a computer in the lab. The questionnaires will ask about your drinking habits and reasons for drinking, any drinking-related problems you have experienced, your personality and typical responses in different situations, your relationships with friends, and related issues;
•	Complete interviews with a trained staff member who will ask you a number of questions about your use of alcohol, tobacco and drug. This interview will be audio-recorded;


    What will happen during the alcohol lab sessions?
You will be asked to return to the lab to complete two in-person alcohol sessions. During the alcohol sessions, you will be asked to complete the same activities as during the baseline session (see above) after consuming a dose of alcohol that could lead to intoxication.
•	During the Low-Dose Alcohol Session, you will be asked to consume a beverage containing a low dose of alcohol intended to raise your breath alcohol concentration (BrAC; similar to blood alcohol concentration) to approximately 0.02 to 0.05g%. The legal threshold for intoxication is 0.08g%. We expect that the session may last up to 5 hours until you are sober. 
•	During the High-Dose Alcohol Session, you will be asked to consume a beverage containing a higher dose of alcohol intended to raise your BrAC to approximately 0.08 to 0.11g% (i.e., at or just above the legal threshold for intoxication). We expect that the session may last up to 8 hours until you are sober.
•	The doses of alcohol that you will receive will be based on your sex and body weight. You will be asked to complete several breathalyzer tests.
•	Women will be required to take a urine stream pregnancy test prior to beverage consumption to ensure that they are not pregnant.
•	At the end of the experimental tasks, you will need to remain at the lab (in a comfortable lounge area with snacks and entertainment) until a breathalyzer test indicates that you are sober (BrAC ≤ 0.04g%).
•	You will be required to go directly home after the experiment, using one of the following means: 
o	(1) riding with a friend or relative who agrees to drive you directly home and nowhere else;
o	(2) riding in a taxi or ride service paid for by the experimenters.
•	You also must agree not to drive or operate large machinery until the next day.
