<b>Researcher’s Name:</b> Dr. Bruce D. Bartholow (Professor, University of Missouri—Columbia)
<b>Project IRB Number:</b> 2095631
<b>Project Title:</b> A rigorous test of dual process model predictions for problematic alcohol involvement.


      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is to test the influence of two individual difference factors, motivation for alcohol and cognitive control, on alcohol use and problems in young adults making the transition to legal drinking (i.e., the 21st birthday). The study will examine how these processes contribute to the increase in alcohol problems, especially alcohol-impaired driving, that is known to occur in the year after the 21st birthday. Knowledge gained from this research will inform efforts to reduce alcohol-related problems in young adult drinkers. </p>

      
      
      <h4> What will I be asked to do? </h4>
      
<p><b>This study involves 3 to 4 in-person lab sessions at the University of Missouri-Columbia as well as 2 online follow-up surveys</b>. The lab sessions will consist of the same activities (e.g., complete a number of questionnaires and computer-based tasks while your brain activity is measured.) but will vary as to whether you will consume a low dose of alcohol, a high dose of alcohol or no alcohol at all.</p>

<p>The first lab visit ("Baseline 1"" or "BL1") will take place <b>shortly before</b> your 21st birthday. It will be a baseline where no alcohol is being consummed.</p>

<p>Some participants, but not all, will be asked to return to the lab for another baseline visit ("BL2"") right after turning 21. It will be another baseline where no alcohol is being consummed.</p>
 
<p>All participants will return to the lab for a session where a low dose of alcohol is consummed and another session where a higher dose of alcohol is consummed.The alcohol sessions will take place less than 2 months after turning 21, so we can study the effects of the birthday on the brain and behavior</p>

<p>Finally, 4 months and 10 months after your birthday, you will be asked to take two online follow-up surveys about your drinking and social habits.</p>


<p> Since you will be asked to consumme alcohol in the lab, we will take precautions to ensure a safe environment before, during and after the visit (e.g., you will need to remain at the lab in a comfortable lounge area with snacks and entertainment until a breathalyzer test indicates that you are sober (BrAC ≤ 0.04g%) AND you will be required to go directly home after the experiment, either by riding with a friend or relative who agrees to drive you directly home and nowhere else; or riding in a taxi or ride service paid for by the experimenters.</p>
