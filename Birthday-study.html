      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is to test the influence of two individual difference factors, motivation for alcohol and cognitive control, on alcohol use and problems in young adults making the transition to legal drinking (i.e., the 21st birthday). The study will examine how these processes contribute to the increase in alcohol problems, especially alcohol-impaired driving, that is known to occur in the year after the 21st birthday. Knowledge gained from this research will inform efforts to reduce alcohol-related problems in young adult drinkers. </p>

      
      
      <h4> What will I be asked to do? </h4>
<p>This study involves 3 to 4 in-person lab sessions: (121 Psychology Building; University of Missouri; Columbia MO 65211)</p>
<li>Baseline #1 will occur up to 6 weeks before your 21st birthday.</li>
<li>Some participants, but not all, will be asked to return to the lab for another baseline visit (BL2) right after turning 21.</li>
<li>Alcohol Session #1 will occur up to 6 weeks after your 21st birthday.</li>
<li>Alcohol Session #2 will occur up to 8 weeks after your 21st birthday, and within 1 or 2 week of the Alcohol Session #1.</li>
<p>The study also involves two online follow-up surveys:
Follow-up #1 will occur 4 months after your 21st birthday.
Follow-up #2 will occur 10 months after your 21st birthday.</p>


<p>It is important for the research project that participants complete all phases of the study, including the 3 laboratory visits and the 2 online follow-up surveys. At the end of todayâ€™s session, you will have the opportunity to decide whether or not you want to continue your participation. However, if you already know that you will be unwilling or unable to complete the remaining phases of the study, we ask that you withdraw at this time. </p>
