<b>Researcher’s Name:</b> Dr. Bruce D. Bartholow (Professor, University of Missouri—Columbia)
<b>Project IRB Number:</b> 2095631
<b>Project Title:</b> A rigorous test of dual process model predictions for problematic alcohol involvement.


      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is to test the influence of two individual difference factors, motivation for alcohol and cognitive control, on alcohol use and problems in young adults making the transition to legal drinking (i.e., the 21st birthday). The study will examine how these processes contribute to the increase in alcohol problems, especially alcohol-impaired driving, that is known to occur in the year after the 21st birthday. Knowledge gained from this research will inform efforts to reduce alcohol-related problems in young adult drinkers. </p>

      
      
      <h4> What will I be asked to do? </h4>
      
<p><b>This study involves 3 to 4 in-person lab sessions at the University of Missouri-Columbia as well as 2 online follow-up surveys</b>. The lab sessions will consist of the same activities (e.g., complete a number of questionnaires and computer-based tasks while your brain activity is measured.) but will vary as to whether you will receive alcohol or not, and whether you receive a low or high dose of alcohol.</p>

<p>The first lab visit ("Baseline 1"" or "BL1") will take place less than 6 weeks <b>before</b> your 21st birthday. It will be a baseline where no alcohol is being consummed.</p>

<p>Some participants, but not all, will be asked to return to the lab for another baseline visit ("BL2"") right after turning 21. It will be another baseline where no alcohol is being consummed.</p>
 
<p>All participants will return to the lab for a session where a low dose of alcohol is consummed and another session where a higher dose of alcohol is consummed.The alcohol sessions will take place less than 2 months after turning 21, so we can study the effects of the birthday on the brain and behavior</p>

<p>Finally, 4 months and 10 months after your birthday, you will be asked to take two online follow-up surveys</p>



      
      


    What will happen during the alcohol lab sessions?
You will be asked to return to the lab to complete two in-person alcohol sessions. During the alcohol sessions, you will be asked to complete the same activities as during the baseline session (see above) after consuming a dose of alcohol that could lead to intoxication.
•	During the Low-Dose Alcohol Session, you will be asked to consume a beverage containing a low dose of alcohol intended to raise your breath alcohol concentration (BrAC; similar to blood alcohol concentration) to approximately 0.02 to 0.05g%. The legal threshold for intoxication is 0.08g%. We expect that the session may last up to 5 hours until you are sober. 
•	During the High-Dose Alcohol Session, you will be asked to consume a beverage containing a higher dose of alcohol intended to raise your BrAC to approximately 0.08 to 0.11g% (i.e., at or just above the legal threshold for intoxication). We expect that the session may last up to 8 hours until you are sober.
•	The doses of alcohol that you will receive will be based on your sex and body weight. You will be asked to complete several breathalyzer tests.
•	Women will be required to take a urine stream pregnancy test prior to beverage consumption to ensure that they are not pregnant.
•	At the end of the experimental tasks, you will need to remain at the lab (in a comfortable lounge area with snacks and entertainment) until a breathalyzer test indicates that you are sober (BrAC ≤ 0.04g%).
•	You will be required to go directly home after the experiment, using one of the following means: 
o	(1) riding with a friend or relative who agrees to drive you directly home and nowhere else;
o	(2) riding in a taxi or ride service paid for by the experimenters.
•	You also must agree not to drive or operate large machinery until the next day.
