      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is understand factors that can increase or decrease the likelihood that teenagers and young adults will drink alcohol and experience negative consequences from drinking. To answer these questions, we are recruiting adolescents and young adults ages 14-19 for a study involving computer tasks, questionnaires, and measures of brain activity. Participants will visit the research lab 3 times over a period of about 30 months. </p>

      <h4> What will participants be asked to do? </h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Participants will visit the research lab three times, at approximately 15-month intervals, to complete questionnaires and simple computer-based tasks. The questionnaires will ask about participants' (and their friends’) experiences with alcohol and other health-related behaviors. The computer-based tasks are designed to help us learn about individual differences in cognitive abilities. We will use a set of harmless sensors to record participants' brain activity while they complete the computer-based tasks. Each lab visit will take about 4 hours and participants will be paid at least $100 for each visit. During each lab visit, participants also will receive snacks, beverages, prizes for task completion, and lab-themed gifts. </p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
In-between lab visits, participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires online, for which they will receive additional payment. </p>

 <h4> Participant compensation </h4>
<p>Participants will receive up to $500 for completing all the phases of the research. Specifically:</p>
<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> $10 for completing the online eligibility screener, and an additional $10 for completing the online questionnaire packet prior to each lab visit (so if you complete all three packets, you will receive a total of $30).</p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> $100 for participation in each of the three lab visits. To thank you for coming back, bonuses of $30 per session will be paid for participating in the Wave 2 and Wave 3 lab visits. </p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> $25 for each of two online questionnaire packets 5 and 10 months after the first two labsessions (so if you complete all 4 packets, you will receive a total of $100)</p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> Small prizes in the lab for completing each task.</p>

<h4> How can I participate? </h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> If you think you might like to participate, we first need to determine if you are eligible.  <strong>Eligibility for the study is determined using a very brief questionnaire.</strong> The questionnaire will ask you about your age, your general health status, a few items about your health history, and about several different health-related behaviors. The link to the eligibility questionnaire is given below. </p>


<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>If you are the parent or guardian of an adolescent age 14-17 </strong> and think they might like to participate, please share this informational website with them.  If they decide to complete the eligibility questionnaire, <strong>please have them complete it in private.</strong>  We are required to maintain the privacy of information provided by all study candidates, whether they be adults or children, so that all are free of concerns about their privacy.</p>

<h4> How is the information I provide on the eligibility questionnaire kept private?</h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>We <strong>WILL NOT</strong> save the answers you provide on the eligibility questionnaire.  A computer algorithm will use your answers to automatically determine whether you are eligible.  Whether you are eligible or not, the information you provide will be erased; not even the researchers will see your information. </p>
<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>We <strong>WILL NOT </strong>ask for your name or any contact information at this point.  If you are determined to be eligible to participate, you can then decide whether you want to share your name and contact information with us.  We will need that information if you want to participate.</p> 
<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> We <strong>WILL NOT </strong>track your IP address or attempt to locate you in any way.
Completing the eligibility questionnaire DOES NOT obligate you to participate in the study.  You can decide at any time whether or not you want to participate.</p>
