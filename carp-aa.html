      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is understand factors that can increase or decrease the likelihood that teenagers and young adults will drink alcohol and experience negative consequences from drinking. To answer these questions, we are recruiting adolescents and young adults ages 14-19, and following them for 2.5 years. </p>

      <h4> What will participants be asked to do? </h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Visit the research lab three times, at approximately 1-year intervals, to complete questionnaires and simple computer-based tasks. The questionnaires will ask about participants' (and their friends’) experiences with drinking alcohol. The computer-based tasks are designed to help us learn about individual differences in various cognitive abilities. We will use a set of harmless sensors to record their brain activity while they complete the computer-based tasks. Each lab visit will take about 4 hours. We try our best to make the visits as enjoyable as possible by providing snacks, beverages, prizes for task completion, and lab-themed gifts. </p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Complete 7 online questionnaire packets in total: 1 online questionnaire packet before each visit, and 2 online questionnaire packets 5 months and 10 months after the first two lab visits.</p>

<h4> How to participate </h4>

First, we will need to determine your eligibility for the study. 

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Adults (≥18 years old) interested candidates:</strong> You should know that providing information in the eligibility screener is completely voluntary and does NOT obligate you to participate in the study. The research team WILL NOT save any of your data gathered via this eligibility screening questionnaire. Your responses will be fed into an algorithm that will automatically determine your eligibility and then will be discarded. Not even the researchers will know the reason(s) why a potential study candidate is determined to be ineligible.

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i> <strong>Parents/guardians who are interested in having their child (<18 years old) participate:</strong> Please have your child complete the eligibility screening questionnaire <strong>in private</strong>.  We are required to maintain the privacy of information provided by study candidates, whether they be adults or children, so that all are free of concerns about their privacy.  We WILL NOT save any of the data gathered via this screening questionnaire, and that responses will be fed into an algorithm that will automatically determine provisional eligibility and then will be discarded.  Not even the researchers will know the reason(s) why a given study candidate is determined to be ineligible. Completing the eligibility screener, regardless of the outcome, does NOT obligate a candidate to participate in the study. Please note that if your child is determined to be eligible based on their responses to the pre-screening questionnaire, the research team will schedule a phone call with the parent/guardian to determine final eligibility and secure your parent/guardian's permission to continue to the informed consent phase of the study protocol.
