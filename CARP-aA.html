      <h4> What will participants be asked to do? </h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Visit the research lab three times, at approximately 1-year intervals, to complete questionnaires and simple computer-based tasks. The questionnaires will ask about participants' (and their friends’) experiences with drinking alcohol. The computer-based tasks are designed to help us learn about individual differences in various cognitive abilities. We will use a set of harmless sensors to record their brain activity while they complete the computer-based tasks. Each lab visit will take about 4 hours. We try our best to make the visits as enjoyable as possible by providing snacks, beverages, prizes for task completion, and lab-themed gifts. </p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Complete 7 online questionnaire packets in total: 1 online questionnaire packet before each visit, and 2 online questionnaire packets 5 months and 10 months after the first two lab visits.</p>
