      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is understand factors that can increase or decrease the likelihood that teenagers and young adults will drink alcohol and experience negative consequences from drinking. To answer these questions, we are recruiting adolescents and young adults ages 14-19, and following them for 2.5 years. </p>

      <h4> What will participants be asked to do? </h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Visit the research lab three times, at approximately 1-year intervals, to complete questionnaires and simple computer-based tasks. The questionnaires will ask about participants' (and their friends’) experiences with drinking alcohol. The computer-based tasks are designed to help us learn about individual differences in various cognitive abilities. We will use a set of harmless sensors to record their brain activity while they complete the computer-based tasks. Each lab visit will take about 4 hours. We try our best to make the visits as enjoyable as possible by providing snacks, beverages, prizes for task completion, and lab-themed gifts. </p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Complete 7 online questionnaire packets in total: 1 online questionnaire packet before each visit, and 2 online questionnaire packets 5 months and 10 months after the first two lab visits.</p>
