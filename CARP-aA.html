      <h4> Purpose of the Study </h4> 
      <p> The purpose of this research is understand factors that can increase or decrease the likelihood that teenagers and young adults will drink alcohol and experience negative consequences from drinking. To answer these questions, we are studying adolescents and young adults ages 14-22. </p>

      <h4> What will participants be asked to do? </h4>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Visit the research lab three times, at approximately 1-year intervals, to complete questionnaires and simple computer-based tasks. The questionnaires will ask about participants' (and their friends’) experiences with drinking alcohol. The computer-based tasks are designed to help us learn about individual differences in various cognitive abilities. We will use a set of harmless sensors to record their brain activity while they complete the computer-based tasks. Each lab visit will take about 4 hours. We try our best to make the visits as enjoyable as possible by providing snacks, beverages, prizes for task completion, and lab-themed gifts. </p>

<p> <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
In addition to the lab visits, you will be asked to complete 1 online questionnaire packet before each visit, and 2 online questionnaire packets 5 months and 10 months after the first two lab visits.  </p>
 


<p> Since you will be asked to consumme alcohol in the lab, we will take precautions to ensure a safe environment before, during and after the visit (e.g., you will need to remain at the lab in a comfortable lounge area with snacks and entertainment until a breathalyzer test indicates that you are sober (BrAC ≤ 0.04g%) AND you will be required to go directly home after the experiment, either by riding with a friend or relative who agrees to drive you directly home and nowhere else; or riding in a taxi or ride service paid for by the experimenters.</p>
