Doctoral candidate Erika Henry received a 2008 travel award to attend the annual meeting of the Society for Psychophysiological Research (SPR) in Austin, TX. <!--readmore-->Her poster, entitled " Alcohol, ERN Amplitude, and State Affect: Unhappy Drunks Still Experience Distress," reports the results of a recent SCN lab experiment showing that alcohol-induced reductions in the amplitude of the ERN (error-related negativity) are not due to failures to detect errors, but rather are associated with changes in positive and negative affect following alcohol consumption. Erika was one of only 15 North American students to receive an award, out of 157 eligible student members of the Society.
