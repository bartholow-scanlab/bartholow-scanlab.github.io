The SCANlab PI, Dr. Bartholow, has accepted a new position as the Ketchel Family Chair and Professor in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa (UI)](https://psychology.uiowa.edu/).  Thus, beginning in fall 2023, part of the SCANlab will be moving to UI.  

However, for at least the next year, the SCANlab also will **continue to operate at the University of Missouri (MU).**  

The ongoing [CLAS study](https://www.scanlab.page/CLASstudy) will continue at the MU location, and a new study will begin at the MU location this fall. 

**Stay tuned for further updates!**
