Chris Loersch is the resident expert in attitudes and social cognition in the SCN Lab, and soon will be able to add "ERP expert" to his list of skills. Dr. Loersch was notified in April that his application to attend the two-week intensive ERP training course, known informally as "ERP Bootcamp," hosted by Dr. Steven Luck each summer at the University of California-Davis Center for Mind and Brain, was approved. Although other SCN Lab members have applied in the past, Chris is the first SCN Lab affiliate to be accepted for this opportunity. Good luck, Chris!
