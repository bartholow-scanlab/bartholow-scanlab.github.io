#### MU Distinguished Master's Thesis Award 

Kelsey Irvin's master's thesis project, which examined neurophysiological responses to reward in emerging adults varying in risk for depression, was selected for the Distinguished Master's Thesis Award by the MU Graduate School. Each department is allowed to forward only one nomination each year, and Kelsey was our department's nominee. Her thesis was judged against all others submitted by other MU departments for clarity of writing, scholarship, methods, and contribution to the field. In other words, Kelsey's project was recognized as the best master's thesis completed at MU in 2018. An outstanding achievement!
