Hannah Volpert has been a Project Manager in the SCANlab for nearly two years, and has done a simply outstanding job. <!--readmore--> Her hard work and dedication recently were recognized with the Gail Raskin Research Staff Award, given each year to the most outstanding staff member in the Department of Psychological Sciences whose duties are dedicated primarily to the research mission of the department. Quoting from her nomination letter, “Hannah exemplifies every one of the qualities embodied by recognition with this award. Her service to the PI and others in the lab, as well as collaborators in other units on campus and at a collaborating university, has been extraordinary.”

We in the SCANlab also are very pleased that Hannah has decided to remain here at Mizzou, and to remain in the SCANlab, to pursue her doctoral training in Social Psychology and social cognitive neuroscience. For the first four years of her graduate training Hannah will be supported by a prestigious Life Sciences Doctoral Fellowship, which provides a generous stipend, tuition waiver and other benefits and permits fellows to pursue their research interests and goals independently. These fellowships are highly competitive and are intended to attract (or, in this case, to retain) outstanding doctoral candidates in the life sciences who otherwise would pursue their graduate training elsewhere. Way to go, Hannah!
