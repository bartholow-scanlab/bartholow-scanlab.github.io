We are very pleased to have Dr. Elena Stepanova join the lab this year. Elena is a social psychologist whose research examines conceptualization of social categories. Elena is interested in understanding the ways in which alcohol might influence processing of visual cues associated with social categories such as race. Elena will also be working on one of our ongoing alcohol administration projects, which is designed to specify effects of alcohol on sub-components of executive cognitive functioning. Welcome, Elena!
