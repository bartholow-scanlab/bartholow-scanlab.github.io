Erika Henry’s dissertation research, which investigates the extent to which individual differences in emotion regulation interact with acute effects of alcohol to influence performance monitoring and adjustment processes, is being funded by a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) from the NIAAA.  This is Erika’s first research grant. (Mentors include Bruce D. Bartholow and Kenneth J. Sher.)
