Alissa Rasmussen was 1 of only 26 winners (out of 420 submissions) of the Psi Chi Research Award for her abstract submitted to the 2010 Midwestern Psychological Association meeting in Chicago, IL. Alissaâ€™s project investigated the effects of acute violent video game exposure on aspects of executive cognitive functioning, including behavioral inhibition and interference control.
