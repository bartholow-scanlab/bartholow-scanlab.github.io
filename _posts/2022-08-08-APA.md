The SCANlab was represented at the 2022 annual convention of the American Psychological Association (APA), which took place Aug 4-6 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 

Dr. Cofres√≠ presented EEG data from one of the sessions of our on-going NIH/NIAAA-funded study (the CLAS Study) at a translational symposium organized by Division 6 of the APA: Society for Behavioral Neuroscience and Comparative Psychology. Two other APA divisions  (28 [Psychopharmacology], 50 [Addiction Psychology]) also featured this symposium as part of their programming at the convention.
