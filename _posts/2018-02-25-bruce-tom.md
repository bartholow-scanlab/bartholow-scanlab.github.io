Bartholow and Piasecki are both PIs on a new R01 grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). **THe NIH grant is to study the association between alcohol sensitivity, reactivity to alcohol-related cues in the lab, and drinking and related behaviors in the natural environment.** <!--readmore-->

This five-year project will involve recruitment of 420 emerging adults to participate in multiple lab sessions and rounds of daily assessments using a smartphone app (ecological momentary assessment). The overall goal of the study is to translate an influential theory of addiction from a preclinical (rodent-based) model to a human model, using a combination of psychophysiological, behavioral, subjective, and ecological assessments of alcohol cue-reactivity and drinking behavior.
