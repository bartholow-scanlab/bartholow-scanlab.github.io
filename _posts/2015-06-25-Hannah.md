Hannah Volpert will receive funds to defray the cost of her attendance at the SPR annual meeting in Seattle, WA in September. She will present the findings of an experiment showing that early visual attention, indicated by the P2 component of the event-related potential, is enhanced when people encounter othersâ€™ negative, unexpected behavior.
