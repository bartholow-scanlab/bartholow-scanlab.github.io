Kimmy Fleming recently was notified that she is one of six winners of the annual Memorial Award, given each year by the Research Society on Alcoholism “to honor RSA members who have recently passed away.” <!--readmore--> Kimmy was selected on the basis of her symposium presentation abstract (on interactions between attention bias and inhibitory control in determining risk for substance use/abuse) and will receive $500 to defray travel costs for the upcoming RSA annual meeting in Bellevue, Washington. Congratulations, Fleming!
