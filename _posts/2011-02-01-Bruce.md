As part of ongoing efforts to understand effects of alcohol on social behaviors, and related efforts aimed at understanding processes that influence expression of implicit racial bias, SCN lab members Chris Loersch and Bruce Bartholow have teamed up with Dr. Jeffrey Sherman (UC-Davis), an expert in social cognition, to conduct experiments investigating these issues. The work is being funded in part by a grant awarded to Dr. Sherman from the National Science Foundation.
