A one-day symposium focusing on the latest research into implicit racial bias will take place on the MU campus on Tuesday, June 14, 2011, hosted by Dr. Bruce Bartholow. <!--readmore--> The symposium will feature talks by Dr. Keith Payne (University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill) and Dr. Jeffrey Sherman (University of California-Davis), two of the top researchers in this field. Other speakers will include Dr. Bartholow, Drs. Tiffany Ito and Akira Miyake from the University of Colorado, and Dr. Joshua Correll from the University of Chicago. The symposium is part of a collaborative grant awarded to Dr. Bartholow and his colleagues (Miyake, Ito, Friedman and Correll) from the National Science Foundation, aimed at investigating how individual differences in cognitive control abilities contribute to the expression of racial bias in laboratory tasks.
