2 new post-doctoral scholars join the SCN Lab in summer 2007, Drs Eunsam Shin and Eduardo Vasquez! Welcome! <!--readmore--> 

Dr. Eunsam Shin, who received her Ph.D. in cognitive neuroscience in 2007 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, joined the SCN lab in August. She has been extending her work on neural attention mechanisms to the study of alcohol cue reactivity and effects of alcohol on attention.

Dr. Eduardo Vasquez, who received his Ph.D. from the University of Southern California in 2006, joined the SCN lab in July 2007. Dr. Vasquez's research focuses primarily on understanding triggered displaced aggression. So far, his work in the SCN Lab has focused on understanding effects of brief exposure to alcohol cues on disinhibition of aggression.
