We were joined in September of 2014 by Ozlem Korucuoglu, a researcher specializing in adolescent alcohol use and other risky behaviors. <!--readmore--> 

<br/>

Dr. Korucuoglu received her Ph.D. from the University of Amsterdam under the supervision of Prof. Reinout Wiers. In the SCANlab Ozlem is focusing on learning latent variable and structural equation modeling and applying these techniques to analyze the acute effects of alcohol on executive functioning as measured with laboratory tasks. She is also involved in research examining effects of extreme binge-drinking episodes (e.g., 21st birthday celebrations) on neurocognitive functions as measured with fMRI, as well as some studies focusing on alcohol cue reactivity measured with ERPs.
