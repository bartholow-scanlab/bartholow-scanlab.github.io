We’re pleased to welcome our first international graduate student, Jorge Martins, to the SCAN lab. <!--readmore--> <br/>

Jorge completed his bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in Psychology at the Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences of the University of Coimbra, Portugal. Jorge’s research interests focus on understanding the complex interplay between impulsivity (i.e., deficits in cognitive control) and affect-regulation motives for engaging in alcohol consumption and sexual behavior. In addition to his work in the SCAN lab, Jorge is also working with Dr. Lynne Cooper, studying the role of ethnic identity as a protective or risk factor of the adverse effects of perceived discrimination on psychological adjustment among non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans. He was awarded a fellowship to complete his PhD at the University of Missouri-Columbia, funded by the Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT; the Portuguese equivalent of the National Science Foundation).
