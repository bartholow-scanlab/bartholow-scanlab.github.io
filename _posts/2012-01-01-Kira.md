We are very pleased that Dr. Kira Bailey has joined the lab this year. Dr. Bailey received her graduate training under the supervision of Dr. Robert West at Iowa State University, focusing primarily on using event-related brain potentials to understand cognitive control processes. <!--readmore--> In our lab, Kira is focusing on applying these techniques to investigate effects of alcohol on cognitive control processes involved in performance monitoring and adjustment. She is also interested in understanding pathological video game use as a form of addiction, and the implications of excessive video game use for cognitive function.
