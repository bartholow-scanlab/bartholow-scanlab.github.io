Research plans are already forming for AY 2022-2023! Two SCANlab research assistants, Ian Flowers and Liam Peck (both Psychology Major), will be doing their Honors Thesis with Drs. Bartholow/Cofresi. In addition, Ian Flowers was accepted into the McNair Scholar program 2022-2023 with Dr. Bartholow as his mentor. Congratulations to both, and looking forward to their independent research!
