Geoff Kerr was 1 of only 21 honorees (out of 320 submissions) to receive a Psi Chi Research Award for his abstract submitted to the 2008 Midwestern Psychological Association meeting in Chicago, IL. Geoffâ€™s project investigated the effects of acute and chronic violent video game exposure on brain activity and aggressive behavior.
