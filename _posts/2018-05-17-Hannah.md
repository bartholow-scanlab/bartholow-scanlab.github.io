Hannah Volpert-Esmond's F31 grant, also known as a Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Predoctoral Fellowship, is being funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. <!--readmore--> The grant will provide two years of funding to support the remainder of Hannah's doctoral training and her dissertation research. Hannah's dissertation work will investigate potential links between the experience of everyday, subtle acts of discrimination and mental health outcomes among African American college students. Her study will combine laboratory-based measures of brain activity with reports of daily experiences recorded using a smartphone app developed by Professor Yi Shang and his team in the MU Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
