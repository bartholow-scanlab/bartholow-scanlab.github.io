PJ received a BA in psychology from Florida Atlantic University in 2016 and an MS in experimental psychology from Nova Southeastern University in 2018. 

His research interests center broadly around the neuroscience of social perception, using Event related-potentials (ERPs) to study how we process traits including race, gender, and sexual orientation in others, and how the way these traits are processed translate to expressions of bias. 

Welcome PJ!
