	<p>	<strong>Characterizing Low Alcohol Sensitivity in Laboratory and Real-World Contexts, "CLAS Study" for short,</strong> is a research study conducted by researchers at the University of Missouri with funding from the National Institutes of Health. The purpose of this study is to increase understanding of factors that can lead to alcohol-related problems in some people.  More specifically, the purpose of this research is to test how individual differences in responses to alcohol and alcohol-related cues (for example, pictures of alcohol, or the smell of alcohol) are associated with different patterns of alcohol use and related behaviors.  This information will help researchers to understand factors that might put people at risk for developing problems with alcohol, or that might protect people from developing such problems.</p>
	
	
<p>	The study has three phases, which will take place over the course of approximately 17 months:</p>

<p><strong>Part 1A ("Session 1"):</strong> Visit the researchers’ lab on the University of Missouri campus in Columbia to complete a number of questionnaires and some behavioral tasks on a computer.  This lab visit will last approximately 4.5 hours, and will involve measurement of brain activity using a set of scalp electrodes.</p>  

<p><strong>Part 1B:</strong> After the lab visit, participants will be asked to complete a 21-day period of daily, brief reports of their drinking experiences and related behaviors using a smartphone app.  (Participants who do not own a smartphone will be provided with one to use for this phase of the study.)  Participants will be guaranteed a minimum of $75 when they complete at least 50% of the Morning Reports but could earn as much as $150 for Part 1B.</p>

This lab visit will also last approximately 4 hours and will also involve measurement of brain activity using a set of scalp electrodes.</p> 

<p><strong>Part 2B:</strong> After the second lab visit, participants again will be asked to complete a 21-day period of daily, brief reports of their drinking experiences and related behaviors using a smartphone app.  Participants will be guaranteed a minimum of $75 when they complete at least 50% of the Morning Reports but could earn as much as $150 for Part 2B.</p>

As with the previous lab visits, this lab visit will also last approximately 4 hours and will also involve measurement of brain activity using a set of scalp electrodes.</p>
